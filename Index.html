    <p class="p1">My name is Hannah and I've recently graduated from High School on  28th December 2021.  I obtained an overall  Grade C in the recent National Grade 12 Bac II exams.
        It's been a long journey to decide which major that I could study and finally I decided to join the Higher Diploma in Software Development at E2STEM and major in Bachelor of Information Technology Engineering at Royal University of Phnom Penh. It's an opportunity that I could join and study at E2STEM for 2 more years as a Higher Diploma Software Developer. Because of the sponsor who supports me at E2STEM, I have this great opportunity to pursue further studies.
        It will be another challenge and a new thing for me to enter University for the first time. It's been 3 weeks since I first attended the Higher Diploma in Software Development programme at E2STEM. There are many interesting things that I have to explore and research more about. In the future, I want to have a good job and I want to help Cambodia to develop in the Education Field with Technology and introduce it to the students in rural areas. I want them to have the same opportunity as me to know what Technology is, what's Computer and 21st Century Skills. 
        I try hard with my studies from high school until university and to become a valuable human resource for Cambodia and help other students by supporting them who don't have opportunity to study and know about 21st century skills.
